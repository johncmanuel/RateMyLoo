# RateMyLoo

A web application for users who want to share pictures of their bathrooms and rate others.

## About

We wanted to create something both simple and funny at the same time, so that is how RateMyLoo came to be.

In RateMyLoo, users can create an account using an email and password. After a successful login, users are presented with two pictures of bathrooms that other users have uploaded. Users can click on the bathroom they think is nicer than the other. This repeats until the user has seen all the images available on the website. From there, the user will have to wait for other users to upload more pictures of their bathrooms.

## Tech Stack

1. Fullstack: Next.js, React
2. Database: Google Firestore
3. Image Bucket: Google Cloud Storage
